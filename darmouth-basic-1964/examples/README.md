### Source files from the handbook

The source files in this folder have been tested (and sometimes adapted for 
them) with 8 bit computers, such as MSX, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64, mostly 
using emulators which allow Copying+Pasting.

You can try the source files in the following way:

* With a "real" 8 bit computer.

* For MSX you can use even the online emulator http://www.webmsx.org    Press Alt+V to open the "paste windows" and then Ctrl+V to paste the text of source file you should have copied (Ctrl+C) first.

* For Amstrad CPC, neither CpcBox nor Roland (both are online emulators) seem to allow pasting text, but you can try WinApe (which currently does not work properly under Windows 10) and press Ctrl+F5 for "Auto-type".

* For Commodore 64 and Commodore 128, you can use WinVICE emulator for Windows, which allows pasting with "Alt+Insert". Note that the source file should be all lowercase before copy-pasting.
